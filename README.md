# Notes

Assignment One -

I think I've got a basic understanding of 'status' 'add' 'commit' and 'push', and I intend to go back and complete the assignment again from the beginning, in order to sort out what I did right or wrong.

Like Tim said, I'll be moving over to his old macbook pro soon, which will be an opportunity to practice setting up my 'workspace'. I'll stick with github for now at least, if that's acceptable.

Wrong-facing quotation marks are a sneaky lil' snitch!
